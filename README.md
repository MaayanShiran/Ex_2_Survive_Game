![survive_game_res](https://github.com/MaayanShiran/Ex_2_Survive_Game/assets/95546841/d6e38584-76b7-45e7-8837-2e45bb5a47c9)

## Description
The game mechanics involve user interactions based on their ID number. 
Each ID number is moduloed by 4 to determine the steps the user needs to take. 
The 7th position number in the ID determines the town's name where the survival challenge takes place. 
The game provides four arrow options, each representing a number between 0 and 3. 
By clicking the correct sequence of arrows, the user can navigate and successfully "survive."

## Steps Taken Toward the Solution
1. **Imported Class Files and Manifest:**
   - Adjusted the manifest to match the project package name and SDK version.

2. **Imported Values Folder:**
   - Brought in the values folder to ensure the necessary resources are available.

3. **URL Cleanup:**
   - Removed unnecessary symbols from the URL, verifying functionality by testing it on Chrome.

4. **XML Files for Class Files:**
   - Imported XML files corresponding to each class to understand and modify layout structures.

5. **Asset Import:**
   - Imported missing assets associated with each XML file to enhance the visual and functional aspects of the game.
