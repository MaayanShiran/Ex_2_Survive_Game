## Description
This project is a reverse engineering exercise focusing on "Survive Game." The goal is to understand and recreate the game by importing class files, manifest, values folder, and associated XML files. The reverse engineering process involves adapting the imported code and assets to match the desired project package name and SDK version.

## Steps Taken Toward the Solution
1. **Imported Class Files and Manifest:**
   - Adjusted the manifest to match the project package name and SDK version.

2. **Imported Values Folder:**
   - Brought in the values folder to ensure the necessary resources are available.

3. **URL Cleanup:**
   - Removed unnecessary symbols from the URL, verifying functionality by testing it on Chrome.

4. **XML Files for Class Files:**
   - Imported XML files corresponding to each class to understand and modify layout structures.

5. **Asset Import:**
   - Imported missing assets associated with each XML file to enhance the visual and functional aspects of the game.
